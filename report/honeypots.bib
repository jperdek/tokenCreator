They are associated with low detection rate and failure to identify zero-day and obfuscated attacks. This paper presents a low-interaction client honeypot that employs multiple signature detection engines in combination with de-obfuscation and de-minification of JavaScript code to improve the detection of attack signatures. Pattern matching in the process of identifying the static malicious code characteristics through using regular expressions, provides additional layer of detection. YALIH can achieve low false positive and false negative rate while significantly reducing scanning time and required hardware resources compared to a high interaction client honeypot. YALIH’s virtual browser can handle cookies, redirection and mimic popular browser headers and imitate referrer information. Our experiments with realworld malicious websites demonstrate that similar to Web Spam, malicious websites utilize referrer tracking and cloaking techniques to deliver malicious content to selected users visiting the target domain from specific referrer websites.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, Windows is an operating system that is very popular among people, especially users who have limited knowledge of computers. But unconsciously, the security threat to the windows operating system is very high. Security threats can be in the form of illegal exploitation of the system. The most common attack is using malware. To determine the characteristics of malware using dynamic analysis techniques and static analysis is very dependent on the availability of malware samples. Honeypot is the most effective malware collection technique. But honeypot cannot determine the type of file format contained in malware. File format information is needed for the purpose of handling malware analysis that is focused on windows-based malware. For this reason, we propose a framework that can collect malware information as well as identify malware PE file type formats. In this study, we collected malware samples using a modern honey network. Next, we performed a feature extraction to determine the PE file format. Then, we classify types of malware using VirusTotal scanning. As the results of this study, we managed to get 1.222 malware samples. Out of 1.222 malware samples, we successfully extracted 945 PE malware. This study can help researchers in other research fields, such as machine learning and deep learning, for malware detection.},

	abstract = {Honeypots are progressively becoming a fundamental cybersecurity tool to detect, prevent and record new threats and attack methodologies used by attackers to penetrate systems. The current technology is advancing rapidly; with the use of virtualisation, and most recently, virtual containers, the deployment of honeypots has become increasingly easier. A varied collection of open source honeypots such as Cowrie are available today, which can be easily downloaded and deployed within minutes—with default settings. Cowrie is a medium-interaction secure shell (SSH) and Telnet honeypot intended to log brute force and shell interaction attacks. However, the current issue with the default Cowrie configuration is that it is easily detected by adversaries using automated scripts and tools. To increase Cowrie’s deceptive capabilities, it is essential to understand, modify, and leverage all capabilities of the honeypot. However, this process is complex, because there are no standard frameworks to interpret the artefacts used by the Cowrie honeypot and how these artefacts link to the type of deceptiveness presented to the cyber-attacker. Therefore, there is a need for some type of infrastructure that can interpret these basic deception techniques and tools, and later developing them into feasible cybersecurity defence mechanisms. This study pursues to develop an understanding about its capabilities, and how these capabilities can be used to bait attackers. The resulting annotations can help cybersecurity defenders better understand the effectiveness of the Cowrie artefacts and how they can be used deceptively.},

One solution is to implement a honeypot system that can be used to improve the security of the Internet network and can detect intrusion attempts or attacks. A honeypot system with a Modern Honey Network (MHN) has been developed to make deployment and management easier and to make the honeypot more secure. The honeypots used in this study are the Kippo, Glastopf, Dionaea honeypots. With testing of the honeypot system in the form of an intrusive attack, it can be concluded that the honeypot system managed to outwit the attacker by opening ports on a server that turned the port into a hoax and was cleared. In addition, the suspicious activity was recorded and the attacks detected.},

Ranum"From the basics of shrink-wrapped honeypots that catch script kiddies to the detailed architectures of next-generation honeynets for trapping more sophisticated bad guys, this book covers it all....This book really delivers new information and insight about one of the most compelling information security technologies today." –Ed Skoudis, author of Counter Hack, SANS instructor, and Vice President of Security Strategy for Predictive SystemsHoneypots are unique technological systems specifically designed to be probed, attacked, or compromised by an online attacker. Implementing a honeypot provides you with an unprecedented ability to take the offensive against hackers. Whether used as simple "burglar alarms," incident response systems, or tools for gathering information about hacker motives and tactics, honeypots can add serious firepower to your security arsenal.Honeypots: Tracking Hackers is the ultimate guide to this rapidly growing, cutting-edge technology. The book starts with a basic examination of honeypots and the different roles they can play, and then moves on to in-depth explorations of six specific kinds of real-world honeypots: BackOfficer Friendly, Specter™, Honeyd, Homemade honeypots, ManTrap®, and Honeynets.Honeypots also includes a chapter dedicated to legal issues surrounding honeypot use. Written with the guidance of three legal experts, this section explores issues of privacy, entrapment, and liability. The book also provides an overview of the Fourth Amendment, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Wiretap Act, and the Pen/Trap Statute, with an emphasis on how each applies to honeypots.With this book you will gain an understanding of honeypot concepts and architecture, as well as the skills to deploy the best honeypot solutions for your environment. You will arm yourself with the expertise needed to track attackers and learn about them on your own. Security professionals, researchers, law enforcement agents, and members of the intelligence and military communities will find this book indispensable.The CD-ROM contains white papers, source code, and data captures of real attacks. Its contents will help you build and deploy your own honeypot solutions and analyze real attacks. 0321108957B08282002},

The honeytokens are characterized by properties which make them appear as genuine data items. Honeytokens are also accessible to potential attackers who intend to violate an organization's security in an attempt to mine information in a malicious manner. One of the main challenges in generating honeytokens is creating data items that appear as real and that are difficult to distinguish from real tokens. In this paper we present "HoneyGen" - a novel method for generating honeytokens automatically. HoneyGen creates honeytokens that are similar to the real data by extrapolating the characteristics and properties of real data items. The honeytoken generation process consists of three main phases: rule mining in which various types of rules that characterize the real data are extracted from the production database; honeytoken generation in which an artificial relational database is generated based on the extracted rules; and the likelihood rating in which a score is calculated for each honeytoken based on its similarity to the real data. A Turing-like test was performed in order to evaluate the ability of the method to generate honeytokens that cannot be detected by humans as honeytokens. The results indicate that participants were unable to distinguish honeytokens having a high likelihood score from real tokens.},
